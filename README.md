# CNN
This is the capstone project for the Machine Learning Tools and Techniques course at VUW. The objective is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model to identify whether an image belongs to the categories of tomato, cherry, or strawberry. May need to manually add test images to the test set.

The accuracy on the unknown test set provided during the on-site evaluation ultimately surpassed 81%.

In the traindata, only a portion of the data has been retained as an example due to its large volume. Please feel free to add more as needed. Additionally, The "drop" folder refers to manually removed noisy data.

The "final_train_model.pth" is the saved train model.
